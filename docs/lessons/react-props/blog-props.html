                        <strong>Header</strong> should include the
                        <strong>Navbar</strong> component.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>BlogList</strong> should include the
                        <strong>BlogPost</strong> component.

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Data Handling:</strong>
                <p>
                    Use the provided array of blog posts to populate the
                    <code>&lt;BlogPost /&gt;</code> component.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pass the <code>title</code>, <code>subTitle</code>,
                    <code>author</code>, and <code>date</code> of each blog post
                    as props to the <code>&lt;BlogPost /&gt;</code> component.
                </p>
                <pre><code>[

                <strong>Design and Styling:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Ensure that the blog text is overlaid on the image and

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Focus on making the page visually appealing and aligned

                    </li>
                    <li>

                        within a focused timeframe.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            </li>
            <li>
                The components should display the blog posts with the
                appropriate titles, subtitles, authors, and dates.
            </li>
            <li>
                The page should be styled to ensure the text is clearly readable

            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
