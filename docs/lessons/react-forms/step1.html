                <p>
                    Forms are essential for any web application. They allow
                    users to interact with your app by submitting data, like
                    filling out registration forms, logging in, or searching for
                    information. In traditional HTML, handling user input can be
                    tricky, often requiring multiple steps to capture and
                    process data.

                <h3>Simplifying Form Handling with React</h3>
                <p>
                    But with React, form handling becomes much simpler! React
                    lets us manage form state and user input more efficiently
                    using its powerful state management and event handling
                    features.

                <h3>React Forms and State</h3>
                <p>
                    Now, let’s talk about the relationship between React forms
                    and state. In React, state is like a container that holds
                    the data that can change in your app. Whenever the state
                    changes, React re-renders the component to reflect these
                    changes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For forms, state is crucial. Each input field in a form can
                    be connected to a piece of state. This is called controlled
                    components. The input fields get their values from the state
                    and update the state whenever they change. This creates a
                    single source of truth for form data, making the management
                    of user input more predictable and easier to debug.

                <h3>Creating a Form Component</h3>
                <p>
                    Instead of hardcoding a form inside <code>App.jsx</code>, we
                    can make it reusable by creating a
                    <code>Form</code> component. Let's create a form with three
                    fields: title, rating, and description.
                </p>
                <h4>Example Code: App.jsx</h4>
                <pre><code class="language-jsx">
import React from 'react';
import Navbar from './Navbar';
import RandomMovie from './RandomMovie';
import FavoriteMovie from './FavoriteMovie';
import Form from './Form';
import { useTheme } from './useTheme';

const App = () => {
  const { theme, toggleTheme } = useTheme();
  const [favMovies, setFavMovies] = React.useState([]);

  const addMovie = (movie) => {
    setFavMovies([...favMovies, movie]);
  };

  return (
    &lt;div className={`${theme} main`}&gt;
      &lt;Navbar toggleTheme={toggleTheme}/&gt;
      &lt;RandomMovie addMovie={addMovie}/&gt;
      &lt;FavoriteMovie favMovies={favMovies}/&gt;
      &lt;Form /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
};

export default App;
            </code></pre>
                <h4>Example Code: Form.jsx</h4>
                <pre><code class="language-jsx">
import React from 'react';

const Form = (props) => {
  return (
    &lt;form&gt;
      &lt;input placeholder=&quot;title&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;input placeholder=&quot;description&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;input placeholder=&quot;rating&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
  );
};

export default Form;
            </code></pre>
            </div>
        </section>
