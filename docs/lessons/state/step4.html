        <h1>Movie Data for MovieBuddy</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The MovieBuddy app relies on a dataset of 52 movies stored in
            <code class="language-javascript">movies.js</code>, providing the
            foundation for random selection, favorites management, and UI
            display. Each movie includes a title, image URL, rating, and
            description, enabling rich, interactive features. This section
            explores the dataset’s structure, its role in MovieBuddy, and how to
            access it in React components.
        </p>

        <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Understand the Movie Dataset</strong>: Examine the
                structure of
                <code class="language-javascript">movies.js</code> and its
                properties (title, imageUrl, rating, description).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Access Data in React</strong>: Learn to import and use
                the dataset in components for rendering and state management.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Support MovieBuddy Features</strong>: Explore how the
                dataset enables random selection, favorites, and navigation.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Plan UI Integration</strong>: Consider how to display
                movie data (e.g., posters via
                <code class="language-javascript">imageUrl</code>) in the UI.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Handle Data Edge Cases</strong>: Ensure robust access to
                array indices to prevent errors like undefined properties.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Movie Dataset</h2>
        <p>
            The <code class="language-javascript">movies.js</code> file exports
            an array of 50 movie objects, each with:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code class="language-javascript">title</code>: The movie’s name
                (e.g., “The Shawshank Redemption”).
            </li>
            <li>
                <code class="language-javascript">imageUrl</code>: A URL to the
                movie’s poster image.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code class="language-javascript">rating</code>: A numerical
                rating (e.g., 9.3).
            </li>
            <li>
                <code class="language-javascript">description</code>: A brief
                summary of the movie’s plot.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Here’s the full dataset, please copy the following array into a file
            called movies.js at the same level as your other components:

        <h2>Using the Dataset in MovieBuddy</h2>
        <p>The dataset supports MovieBuddy’s core features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Random Selection</strong>: Access a random movie with
                <code class="language-javascript"
                    >movies[Math.floor(Math.random() * movies.length)]</code
                >.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Favorites</strong>: Store movie objects in a state array
                for the favorites list.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Navigation</strong>: Use
                <code class="language-javascript">movies.length</code> to manage
                index bounds for next/previous buttons.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>UI Display</strong>: Render
                <code class="language-javascript">title</code>,
                <code class="language-javascript">rating</code>,
                <code class="language-javascript">description</code>, and
                <code class="language-javascript">imageUrl</code> as images.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Example: Displaying a Movie</h2>
        <p>Here’s how to render a movie’s details:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">import movies from './movies';

function MovieDisplay() {
  const movie = movies[0]; // Example: First movie

  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;img src={movie.imageUrl} alt={movie.title} style={{ maxWidth: '200px' }} /&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;{movie.title}&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Rating: {movie.rating}&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;{movie.description}&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre>
        <p>
            This displays the movie’s poster, title, rating, and description,
            setting the stage for dynamic rendering with state.
        </p>

        <h2>Analogy</h2>
        <p>
            The movie dataset is like a movie theater’s film catalog. Each movie
            (object) is a reel with details (title, poster, rating, summary).
            The theater staff (React components) can pick a reel randomly,
            display its poster on a marquee (UI), or add it to a “Favorites”
            shelf (state array). The catalog’s structure ensures staff can
            quickly find and use any reel without errors.
        </p>

        <h2>Pitfall</h2>
        <p>Accessing invalid indices can cause errors:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">// Incorrect
const movie = movies[100]; // Undefined, causes errors

// Correct
const movie = movies[movieIndex % movies.length]; // Ensures valid index
</code></pre>
        <p>
            Always validate indices or use modulo to wrap around, especially
            when navigating or selecting randomly.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Integration Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Use <code class="language-javascript">imageUrl</code> with
                <code class="language-javascript">&lt;img&gt;</code> tags,
                setting <code class="language-javascript">alt</code> for
                accessibility.
            </li>
            <li>
                Format <code class="language-javascript">rating</code> to one
                decimal (e.g.,
                <code class="language-javascript">movie.rating.toFixed(1)</code
                >).
            </li>
            <li>
                Truncate
                <code class="language-javascript">description</code> for UI
                brevity if needed (e.g., first 100 characters).
            </li>
        </ul>
