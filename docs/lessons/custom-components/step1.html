        <h1>Introduction to React Custom Components</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            In this section, we’ll dive into custom components, the reusable
            building blocks of React applications. You’ll learn to define
            components, add JSX to your app, and use fragments for clean UI
            structure.
        </p>
        <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Define what a custom component is in React.</li>
            <li>Add JSX to the <code>App</code> component.</li>
            <li>Describe React fragments and their purpose.</li>
            <li>Create header, navbar, and footer components.</li>
            <li>Identify the need for separate component functions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What are Custom Components?</h2>
        <p>
            Custom components are user-defined React elements that encapsulate
            UI functionality. They’re like JavaScript functions that return JSX,
            enabling modular, reusable UI design.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Analogy:</strong> Components are like furniture pieces in a
            house—each (e.g., a table) has a specific role and can be reused in
            different rooms.
        </p>
        <h3>Why Use Them?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Reusability:</strong> Use components across your app to
                avoid repetition.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Modularity:</strong> Break complex UIs into manageable
                pieces.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Maintainability:</strong> Update one component without
                impacting others.
            </li>
        </ul>

            <strong>Quick Exercise (5 min):</strong> Discuss with a partner:
            Name a website feature (e.g., footer) that could be a custom
            component. Write one benefit of making it a component in your notes.
