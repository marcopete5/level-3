                    You will take your assessment once you have completed all of
                    your assignments, quiz and capstone project. Before you
                    begin your capstone project, go ahead and schedule an
                    assessment by messaging your instructor. Give yourself time
                    to complete the project! Schedule 5-7 days from the start of
                    your project. Make sure you choose a time slot that works
                    with your schedule.
